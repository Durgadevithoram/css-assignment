    <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
      <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media.</li>
      <li><del>Css is not necessary</del><mark>CSS saves a lot of work.</mark>It can control the layout of multipule web pages all at once.</li>
      <li><Ins>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files</Ins></li>
    </ol>
    <b>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</b>
    <ol>
      <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements.</li>
      <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section.</li>
      <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
      <li>The most common way to add CSS,is to keep the styles in external CSS files.However,<mark>in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</mark>because this is easier to demonstrate,and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
    </letter-spacing:0.1em>
    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID,the difference is that CSS class appiles a style to multiple elements.ID,on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element.ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>
    <p>In CSS,selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page.Once an element has been targeted,astyle or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
    <p>There is a wide range of selectors available.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID.Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
